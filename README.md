# Testing the Spotify Web API with Spotipy Wrapper

## Obtain information about the the audio features of songs given a user's input.
## So far data is only displayed in the API route /api/features and not on the page. After your submission, visit the /api/features route to see the results.
## Note some issues may result if an album is too far back in the artist's discography or if the artist is not the first result when searched on Spotify. I will attempt to fix this issue as soon as I can.
